.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ifscanctl
.Nd control the wifi management daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ifscanctl
.Ar interface
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls the
.Xr ifscand 8
daemon.
.Pp
The following commands are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm add AP
.Oo
.Op Ar with BSSID
.Op Ar using KEYTYPE
.Op Ar key KEY
.Op Ar mac MACADDR
.Op Ar inet IP/MASK
.Op Ar gw  GATEWAY
.Op Ar inet6 IP/MASK
.Op Ar gw6 GATEWAY
.Oc
.Pp
Remember access point named "AP". The only mandatory argument
is "AP". Optional keywords configure various elements of the
association:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "inet6 IP6/MASK6" -compact
.It with BSSID
The "with" keyword pins a specific BSSID to the access
point "AP". The BSSID should be specified as six colon separated
hex values (e.g., 60:00:0a:18:2b:5c).
.Pp
.It using KEYTYPE
The "using" keyword specifies a keytype. Valid values for
KEYTYPE are "wep" and "wpa".
.Pp
.It key KEY
The "key" keyword provides a shared secret key for joining with
"AP". The key can be a string (WEP or WPA) or of the form
``n:k1,k2,k3,k4'' where `n' specifies which of the keys will be used
for transmitted packets, and the four keys - ``k1'' through ``k4''
are configured as WEP keys. The length of WEP keys must be 40 bits
for 64-bit encryption and 104 bits for 128-bit encryption.
.Pp
It is an error to use the "key" keyword without a corresponding
"keytype" keyword and vice-versa.
.Pp
.It mac MAC
The "mac" keyword configures the host (station) MAC address while
joining to access point "AP". If MAC is the special value "random",
then
.Xr ifscand 8
will generate a random MAC address for the host before joining. This
can be verified by looking at 
.Xr ifconfig 8
output for the interface in question. While the "mac" keyword is optional
we recommend using the "random" option whenever possible. It
preserves user privacy (makes tracking hard).
.Pp
.It inet IP/MASK
The "inet" keyword configures a static IPv4 address and netmask. The
mask can be dotted-quad or CIDR format. e.g., both of the following
are valid:
.Pp
.D1 192.168.11.20/255.255.255.0
.D1 192.168.11.20/24
.Pp
.It gw GATEWAY
Set GATEWAY as the default IPv4 gateway for the host. This is
optional.
.Pp
.It inet6 IP6/MASK6
The "inet6" keyword configures a static IPv6 address and netmask.
.Pp
.It gw6 GATEWAY6
Set GATEWAY6 as the default IPv6 gateway for the host. This is
optional.
.Pp
.El
.Pp
If neither "inet" or "inet6" are specified, the default is to use
DHCP for obtaining an address for the interface. In this case, 
.Xr ifscand 8
starts and stops
.Xr dhclient 8
as needed to fetch the dynamic IP address for the interface.
.Pp
.It Cm del AP
Forget access point "AP".
.It Cm list
Show list of remembered access points.
.It Cm scan
Scan the interface for access points and display the results.
.It Cm down
Gracefully shutdown
.Xr ifscand 8
and stop monitoring the interface in question.
.It Cm set randmac Ar true | false
Globally set the "randomize mac-address" property for any access
points joined by
.Xr ifscand 8 .
This setting is used if the configuration for a specific access
point does not have a "mac" property set.
.It Cm set ap-order Ar AP1 Op Ar AP2...
Sets the relative order of access points when more than one
preferred access points are found.
.It Cm get Ar all | randmac | ap-order
Display all settings or a specific setting.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
Add an access point with network id "home5G" and WPA password
"frungulate":
.Pp
.Dl $ ifscanctl iwm0 add home5G using wpa key frungulate
.Pp
Add an access point with network id "FreeWireless", no password and
randomized host MAC address:
.Pp
.Dl $ ifscanctl iwm0 add FreeWireless mac random
.Pp
Add an access point with network id "SecureWork" and WPA password
"officiatus" and BSSID pinned to 57:00:1a:33:2f:bc:
.Pp
.Dl $ ifscanctl iwm0 add SecureWork with 57:00:1a:33:2f:bc using wpa key officiatus
.Pp
Add a 4G hotspot with network id "Pixelnet" and WPA password
"unwirednet" and make it override any other visible access point:
.Dl $ ifscanctl iwm0 add PixelNet using wpa key unwirednet
.Dl $ ifscanctl iwm0 add ap-order PixelNet
.Sh FILES
