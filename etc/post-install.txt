ifscand and ifscanctl are now installed in /usr/local/

If you want the daemon to start at boot:

  - copy /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ifscand /etc/rc.d/
  - append /usr/local/etc/rc.conf.local to /etc/rc.conf.local
  - edit /etc/rc.conf.local with the interface to be watched

Please refer to the manpages (ifscand(8), ifscanctl(8)) for details.
